    Get dependable hot water with professional tank water heater installation
    from Galico's licensed gas technicians. We ensure safe, code-compliant
    installations built for Ontario homes.
  description:
    - Hot water tank remain one of the most reliable and cost-effective hot
      water solutions for homes in the Ottawa Valley. Galico specializes in
      professional tank water heater installation, providing homeowners with
      dependable hot water systems designed for long service life and consistent
      performance.
    - We install both gas and electric tank water heaters, carefully sized to
      match your household's hot water demand. Proper sizing is critical — an
      undersized tank leads to frequent cold-water complaints, while an
      oversized unit wastes energy and space. Our installation process accounts
      for household size, usage patterns, fuel availability, and local water
      conditions to ensure the system performs as expected.
    - In hard-water areas, tank systems offer a key advantage; they are more
      forgiving of mineral buildup than compact heat exchangers found in
      tankless units. We take additional steps during installation to support
      long-term reliability, including proper venting, safe connections, and
      commissioning to manufacturer specifications. When applicable, we also
      advise on maintenance practices that help extend tank lifespan.
    - Whether you're replacing a failed water heater or upgrading an aging
      system, our focus is on safe installation, predictable performance, and
      clear expectations — so you can count on hot water without surprises.

    Upgrade to continuous hot water and lower energy bills with Galico's
    professional tankless water heater installation. Perfect for modern Ontario
    homes.
  description:
    - Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand and are an excellent
      option for homes looking to reduce energy use and free up floor space.
      Galico installs tankless water heaters with a focus on proper sizing, fuel
      compatibility, and long-term reliability — especially in Ottawa Valley
      water conditions.
    - Unlike tank systems, tankless units rely on compact heat exchangers that
      must be correctly matched to household demand. Galico evaluates the number
      of occupants, peak hot water usage, available fuel, and incoming water
      temperature to determine the appropriate unit capacity. For gas systems,
      this includes confirming gas supply sizing and venting requirements before
      installation.
    - In areas with hard water, tankless systems require thoughtful planning.
      Galico ensures installations are completed to manufacturer specifications
      and explains realistic maintenance expectations, including periodic
      descaling to protect efficiency and lifespan. When installed and
      maintained properly, tankless systems can deliver continuous hot water
      with excellent performance.
    - Tankless water heater installation is ideal for homeowners who value
      efficiency, space savings, and consistent hot water — and Galico ensures
      the system is installed correctly from day one.

    - Electric water heaters offer a straightforward and cost-effective solution
      for many homes, particularly where gas service is unavailable. Galico
      installs electric water heaters with a focus on correct sizing, safe
      electrical connections, and long-term reliability.
    - Proper sizing is critical for electric systems. Galico evaluates household
      size and hot water usage to recommend a tank capacity that delivers
      consistent performance without excessive operating costs. In hard-water
      regions, electric systems require careful consideration, as heating
      elements can accumulate mineral scale more quickly if undersized or
      improperly installed.
    - Each electric water heater installation includes verification of
      electrical capacity, proper circuit protection, secure plumbing
      connections, and commissioning to manufacturer specifications. Galico
      ensures the system is installed safely and operates as intended from the
      first day of use.
    - Electric water heaters are well suited for smaller households, municipal
      water supplies, and homes seeking a reliable hot water solution with lower
      upfront cost. Galico's installation process ensures dependable performance
      and clear expectations for operation and maintenance.

      system, our certified technicians create custom hydronic solutions that
      maximize comfort, reduce energy bills, and eliminate cold spots. We
      specialize in radiant floor heating for tile, hardwood, and concrete
      slabs, as well as hydronic baseboard, all integrated with modern,
      high-efficiency boilers or heat sources. Every system we install meets
      Ontario building codes, includes proper zoning controls, and is thoroughly
      pressure-tested for reliability and safety. As trusted heating
      professionals serving Ottawa, we understand the region's climate demands
      and prioritize durable, low-maintenance systems that provide years of
      dependable comfort.
