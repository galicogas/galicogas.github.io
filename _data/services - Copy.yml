    Reliable hot water starts with a properly installed gas water heater. Galico specializes in
    residential gas water heater installation and replacement, ensuring safety, efficiency,
    and long-term performance.

  description:
    - Tank water heaters remain one of the most reliable and cost-effective hot water solutions for homes in the Ottawa Valley. Galico specializes in professional tank water heater installation, providing homeowners with dependable hot water systems designed for long service life and consistent performance.

    - We install both gas and electric tank water heaters, carefully sized to match your household’s hot water demand. Proper sizing is critical — an undersized tank leads to frequent cold-water complaints, while an oversized unit wastes energy and space. Our installation process accounts for household size, usage patterns, fuel availability, and local water conditions to ensure the system performs as expected.

    - In hard-water areas, tank systems offer a key advantage; they are more forgiving of mineral buildup than compact heat exchangers found in tankless units. We take additional steps during installation to support long-term reliability, including proper venting, safe connections, and commissioning to manufacturer specifications. When applicable, we also advise on maintenance practices that help extend tank lifespan.

    - Whether you’re replacing a failed water heater or upgrading an aging system, our focus is on safe installation, predictable performance, and clear expectations — so you can count on hot water without surprises.

    Upgrade to endless hot water and improved energy efficiency with a professionally installed
    tankless water heater.

  description: 
    - Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand and are an excellent option for homes looking to reduce energy use and free up floor space. Galico installs tankless water heaters with a focus on proper sizing, fuel compatibility, and long-term reliability — especially in Ottawa Valley water conditions.

    - Unlike tank systems, tankless units rely on compact heat exchangers that must be correctly matched to household demand. Galico evaluates the number of occupants, peak hot water usage, available fuel, and incoming water temperature to determine the appropriate unit capacity. For gas systems, this includes confirming gas supply sizing and venting requirements before installation.

    - In areas with hard water, tankless systems require thoughtful planning. Galico ensures installations are completed to manufacturer specifications and explains realistic maintenance expectations, including periodic descaling to protect efficiency and lifespan. When installed and maintained properly, tankless systems can deliver continuous hot water with excellent performance.

    - Tankless water heater installation is ideal for homeowners who value efficiency, space savings, and consistent hot water — and Galico ensures the system is installed correctly from day one.

  - Electric water heaters offer a straightforward and cost-effective solution for many homes, particularly where gas service is unavailable. Galico installs electric water heaters with a focus on correct sizing, safe electrical connections, and long-term reliability.

    - Proper sizing is critical for electric systems. Galico evaluates household size and hot water usage to recommend a tank capacity that delivers consistent performance without excessive operating costs. In hard-water regions, electric systems require careful consideration, as heating elements can accumulate mineral scale more quickly if undersized or improperly installed.

    - Each electric water heater installation includes verification of electrical capacity, proper circuit protection, secure plumbing connections, and commissioning to manufacturer specifications. Galico ensures the system is installed safely and operates as intended from the first day of use.

    - Electric water heaters are well suited for smaller households, municipal water supplies, and homes seeking a reliable hot water solution with lower upfront cost. Galico’s installation process ensures dependable performance and clear expectations for operation and maintenance.

We specialize in radiant floor heating for tile, hardwood, and concrete slabs, as well as hydronic baseboard, all integrated with modern, high-efficiency boilers or heat sources. Every system we install meets Ontario building codes, includes proper zoning controls, and is thoroughly pressure-tested for reliability and safety. As trusted heating professionals serving Ottawa, we understand the region’s climate demands and prioritize durable, low-maintenance systems that provide years of dependable comfort.
