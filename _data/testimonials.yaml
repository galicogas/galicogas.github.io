    Eric was great, communicated well to narrow down the scope of the project,
    provided detail quotes and easy online payment. His work was clean and tidy
    and he arrived exactly when he said he would.

    I hired Galico to install a propane fridge at my off-grid cottage. I was
    very pleased with the professional and friendly service I received and I
    highly recommend Galico. Thank you, Eric, for your diligence and attention
    to detail.

    Galico Home Comfort came to disconnect the gas line from my stove, and the
    technician was quick, efficient, and very reasonably priced. We thought we
    had a minor issue afterward, but he resolved it right away — no stress at
    all. He was kind, understanding, and clearly takes pride in his work. I'd
    absolutely hire them again for future projects or home solutions. Highly
    recommend!

    Eric did a good job installing our new gas stove. He was quick, efficient,
    and communicated everything clearly throughout the process. He arrived on
    time, completed the installation smoothly, and made sure everything was
    safely set up. He took time to give us a demo after the installation, making
    sure we understood how to use the appliance correctly. Highly recommend Eric
    and Galico Home Comfort for anyone looking for reliable and skilled gas
    appliance services!

    Galico (Eric) provides very quick and eficient service at a very reasonable
    price. We recently had to swap out our old gas range for a new one and Eric
    came by to disconnect the old one so it could be taken away by the delivery
    service and then returned on a very timely basis to connect the new one
    after we advised him it had been delivered. Eric is very responsive and
    communicative. We highly recommend Galico!

    Great service, very professional and knowledgeable. Éric really takes the
    time and effort to do things properly. We have retained his services twice
    now for our gas cookers and we're very satisfied.

    We engaged Galico to install a complete hydronic heating system for a large
    custom home, and the results were outstanding. The project involved gas
    fitting, boiler, radiant floor heating for both the basement and garage,
    indirect hot water tank, and fireplace. Galico's team was professional and
    meticulous from start to finish. We have the highest confidence in Galico
    and would not hesitate to recommend them for any complex heating project.

    I cannot recommend Galico highly enough! We had been dealing with a frustrating issue with our gas furnace for weeks. Another company in Kanata came out multiple times, charged us for service calls, and honestly, just couldn't figure it out. They either misdiagnosed the problem or left it running poorly. I called Galico as a last resort, and the difference was night and day. Their technician arrived on time, took the time to properly diagnose the system, and found the root cause that the previous guys missed. He fixed it on the spot, and our furnace has been running perfectly ever since. If you live in Kanata and need a reliable HVAC company that actually knows what they are doing, save yourself the runaround and call Galico. They earned a customer for life.
